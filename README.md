# ELK-Stack-for-easy-log-management
Log management (LM) comprises an approach to dealing with large volumes of computer generated log messages (such as event-logs). In an enterprise, there are a huge number of machines such as Linux Machines, Routers, Apache Servers etc. which generate hundreds of logs every minute.  Log management is often considered a complex exercise. Understanding log management tends to be a slow and evolutionary process. In response to issues and problems, new SysAdmins use a combination of cat, tail and grep (and often sed, awk or Perl too) become the tools of choice to diagnose and identify problems in log and event data. But these are not efficient and the complexity involved in the procedure is high. So, a simple process of log management needs to be evolved.
